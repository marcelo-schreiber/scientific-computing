# Scientific computing

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the scientific computing course at the Federal University of Paran√°. The course is taught in C and covers the following topics:

- Floating point arithmetic
- Linear systems
- Interpolation

## Projects

The projects are divided into the following folders:

- `float-error-iee754`: Floating point arithmetic
- `perfEG`: Linear systems
- `interpolation`: Interpolation

Almost all projects have a `Makefile` to compile the code. To compile the code, just run `make` in the project folder and remember to read the `README.md` file in each folder to understand how to run the code.

Most of them also require Likwid to be installed. To install it, follow the instructions in the [official repository](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid).
